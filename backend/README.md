## app.js
import: express, createServer from node:http,server from socket.io, mongoose, dotenv, cors, http-status, bcrypt, jwt

**CreateServer** and **Server** are use to connect 2 diff server of express and socket.io like createServer 
    |- Server
    |- io
    |- app --> express app
so we listen parent class (i.e server)

# What we do in production in io server config

Instead of origin: "*", you restrict origins to only your trusted frontend domains.
For example, if your React frontend is deployed at https://myzoomclone.com, you‚Äôd do:

~~~
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: ["https://myzoomclone.com"],  // ‚úÖ allow only your frontend
    methods: ["GET", "POST"],             // allow only needed methods
    allowedHeaders: ["Authorization", "Content-Type"], // ‚úÖ only required headers
    credentials: true,                     // only works safely with restricted origins
  },
});
~~~

### üîπ Typical best practices in production

1. Whitelist origins
  origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL // e.g., https://myzoomclone.com
2. You can even make it an array if you support multiple domains:
  origin: ["https://app1.com", "https://app2.com"]

### üîπ Why we do this in development

1. origin: "*" ‚Üí allows any frontend (React app running on localhost:3000, Postman, etc.) to connect.
2. allowedHeaders: ["*"] ‚Üí lets clients send any headers without restrictions.
3. It makes development fast & flexible ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to worry about CORS errors when testing.
üëâ In short: In dev, we trust the environment and just ‚Äúopen the gates‚Äù so things work easily.

### events in socket
a. connection
  1. join-call ( create room with socketid and timestamp)
    1.1. user-joined (add user in room and send the room info to that user and others in that room)
    1.2. chat-message ( server send the chat history to the new user)
  2. signal (establish connection)
  3. chat-message (store the room and socketid, msg:sender,data,socketid, send that msg to all users in that room except sender)
  4. disconnect ( parse the connections,remove users and delete room, duration of room)
    4.1. user-left (msg to user left and remove that user from room)

## Notes / pitfalls:

The server finds only the first room that contains the socket ‚Äî if you intended sockets can be in multiple rooms, this will only return the first room found. In this app design it seems sockets have one room, so it's OK.

Storing all messages in memory means messages will grow indefinitely ‚Äî for production use you‚Äôd persist to a DB or cap history length.

# user controllers 
- register user ( we get name,username, password)
  1. check if user already exist
  2. hash the password
  3. create user
  4. save user in db
  5. return user
- login user ( we get username, password)
  1. check if user exist
  2. check if password is correct
  3. create a token and send it to client
  4. return user
- get user history (we get token from client)
  1. check if token is valid
  2. get user from token
  3. return user history of meetings
- create a history (we get token from client and meetingCode)
  1. check if token is valid
  2. get user from token
  3. create a history of meeting by meetingCode and username from token 
  4. return history of meeting







## Note:
- keep moduler and separation of concerns
- check functions properly
- import file name properly
- save credenticals as tokens in db
- use logs to debug
